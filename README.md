### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a brazilian front-end developer! HTML, CSS and JavaScript are my jams. I'll get into back-end soon enough.

I'm transitioning from my previous career of ten years as a civil engineer. As much as exciting and challeging it was, I've come to understand that coding is my passion.

Here's how you can reach me:<br><br>
